# Test File

The purpose of this file is to test out Markdown's different syntax.

Here we can make text **bold** or *italics* or _**both**_.

We could choose to link to a site such as my [Github Page](https://github.com/dvyno).

## This is a subheader

I could choose to quote something such as the description of this course

> Hands-on exploration of software development tools and techniques. 
> Investigation of the scientific process as applied to software development 
> and debugging. Emphasis is on weekly hands-on laboratory experiences, 
> development of laboratory notebooking techniques as applied to software design.


That was taken from the [CSE course catalog](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html).

## Final touches

For the last thing, here's an image of a butterfly
